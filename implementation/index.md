# Implementation

## Part 2: Design and start of MVP

Based on your proof of concept, you can now start studying your problem in more detail. 

* First summarize your idea in a single sentence, connecting it to your research question.
* Create a visual sketch of what the final product will look like for the user; if you envision the application to have multiple elements, sketch these all out separately. Clearly specify the possible user interactions, and include concrete examples of data. Your sketches do not have to be professional-looking, but they have to be complete and neat! An example sketch for a data visualization:

* Create a list of main features that will be available to users. All features should also be visible in the sketch. Keep it brief.
* Split the features into 1) the minimum viable product (MVP) and 2) parts that are optional to implement.

A minimum viable product is the product with as least features as possible, which still helps solve the problem for your target audience. We think it’s important to clearly define this, because it defines the minimum amount of work that you will have to put into the project.

Other parts of your project may be optional to implement or “nice to have”.

Plan a zoom meeting to show your completed design. As soon as you have a clear design for the project, start programming your solution! 

## Part 3: Minimum Viable Product

This week, you’ll work towards finishing a MVP version of your project. Make sure that you have all your data ready this week, and that there is basic interaction, core functionality is mostly implemented. It need not be finished in terms of small bugs and code quality. 

Again, plan a zoom meeting to show off your MVP.

## Part 4: Final Product

Before submission, compare your solution to the project [requirements](/project/requirements) one last time. Also, is it still clear that your proposed project is indeed a solution to the research question? 

Code quality is also taken into account. Make sure to write your code in functions and add comments to ensure your code is well readable.

Finally, make sure that your document is spell-checked, and that images are not too large or too small.

Schedula a zoom meeting with your TA before you hand in your final version.
