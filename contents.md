# Project

Until now, we've shown you exactly what to learn and when. The goal of this project is to find your own subject. Something that you're interested about. In the end we want to see that you can learn a new subject by yourself.

We will suggest some possible subjects ([see below](#projects)), but they're only that: suggestions. You can propose your own subject. Are you already working on some data for you studies/work/research? You can use that for this project. Discuss your subject with one of the teachers before you start.

You have very little time for this project. It should not take up more than the equivalent of one full-time week (40 hours). So it is very important to limit the scope of your project.

The project is going to be evaluated based on the following:

* A process book. Here you document the *learning* process. This should be a day-to-day answering the questions: What have you learned? When? How?
* A final product. The Jupyter Notebook final analysis or visualization.
* Project description. A short document (max. 1000 words) of what the project is about. What is the research question? Which data did you use?

The main goal of the project is for you to learn a new technique. So it is important that your work shows clearly what you've learned.

Every project should start with some (research) question.

### Process book

At the start of the project, create a process book in which you keep track of your progress during the project. Note that it is not necessary to describe in detail what you have been working on every day. Just describe your most important findings and challenges during the project. And document the resources you've used (documentation, data resources, tutorials, video's etc.). Some things to keep in mind:

1. **Don't forget the process book.** Maintain it every day you've worked on the project. This is the main way for us to see what you've learned and is an important part of the evaluation.
2. **Don't use it for everything.** Don't spend too much time on your process book! Ten minutes every day you've worked on the project on this, should be more than enough.
3. **Keep it simple and short.** Use simple language, short sentences, and be as straightforward as possible when documenting your learning process.
4. **Create a simple template.** In order to organize your process book, it is nice to create and use a template:

    * Date of entry:
    * What I've worked on:
    * What problems I encountered:
    * What I learned:
    * Which resources did I use:


### Projects

Whatever project you're going to do. Bear in mind:

1. **Tell us what you're going to do.** Plan a meeting (helpdesk) or come to the lab-session and tell us your plan. Whether you decide to take on one of our suggested projects or do your own. We want to know what you're going to work on before you start! We will help you keeping the project manageable.
2. **Keep it simple.** Forty hours is not a lot of time. This is not a thesis. Learning a new technique already takes a lot of time, so keep the project itself simple.
3. **Learn something new.** Make sure you use something (a library, algorithm, concept) that hasn't been discussed in the course already.
3. **Use GitHub for storing and sharing your code.** Make regular GitHub backups (don't forget to push to remote) to make sure you don't loose your code. And use the GitHub repository to share your code with us.

#### Suggested projects

The list below is meant as an inspiration. You can do the project as described, you can make it your own, or you can even think of your own project.

* Mine book descriptions from Goodreads to generate keywords. *Learn* to use the spaCy NLP-library and TF-IDF. [more...](/project/goodreads)
* Make interactive plots to understand the development of life expectancy and fertility for different countries between 1964 and 2013. *Learn* to use the Bokeh visualization library [more...](/project/development)
